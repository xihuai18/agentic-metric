# Agentic Metric

[中文文档](README-CN.md)

A local-only monitoring tool for AI coding agents. Track token usage and costs across Claude Code, Cursor, and more — with a TUI dashboard and CLI.

**All data stays on your machine. No network requests, no telemetry, no data leaves your computer.** The tool only reads local agent data files (e.g. `~/.claude/`) and process info.

## Features

- **Live monitoring** — Detect running agent processes, incremental JSONL session parsing
- **Cost estimation** — Per-model pricing table, calculates API-equivalent costs
- **Today overview** — Sessions, token usage, and cost summary for the current day
- **Historical trends** — 30-day daily token/cost trends
- **TUI dashboard** — Terminal UI with 1-second live refresh, stacked token charts, and trend lines
- **Multi-agent** — Plugin architecture, supports Claude Code and Cursor, extensible

## Data Sources

| Agent | Path | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/` | JSONL sessions, token usage, model, branch |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` | Daily activity stats |
| Cursor | `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` | Composer sessions, token usage, model |
| Cursor | Process detection | Running status, working directory |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/` | JSONL sessions, token usage, model |

All aggregated data is stored locally in `~/.local/share/agentic_metric/data.db` (SQLite).

## Installation

```bash
pip install agentic-metric
```

## Usage

```bash
agentic-metric status          # Show currently active agents
agentic-metric today           # Today's usage overview
agentic-metric history         # Historical trends (default 30 days)
agentic-metric history -d 7    # Last 7 days
agentic-metric sync            # Force sync data to local database
agentic-metric tui             # Launch TUI dashboard
```

### TUI Keybindings

## Agent Data Coverage

Different agents expose different levels of local data. Here's what's available for each:

| Field | Claude Code | Codex | Cursor |
|-------|:-----------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Session ID | ✓ JSONL | ✓ JSONL | ✓ composerId |
| Project path | ✓ JSONL | ✓ JSONL | ◐ partial (from bubble or conversationState) |
| Git branch | ✓ JSONL | ✓ JSONL | ✗ not stored |
| Model | ✓ JSONL | ✓ JSONL | ✓ modelConfig / bubble modelInfo |
| Input tokens | ✓ per-message | ✓ cumulative | ◐ ~75% of sessions |
| Output tokens | ✓ per-message | ✓ cumulative | ◐ ~75% of sessions |
| Cache tokens | ✓ read + write | ✓ read only | ✗ not exposed |
| User turns | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Message count | ✓ all messages | ✓ AI replies only | ✓ all messages |
| First/last prompt | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ from bubble text |
| Cost estimation | ✓ | ✓ | ◐ only when tokens available |
| Live active status | ✓ PID + session file match | ✓ PID + session file match | ◐ process-level only (latest session marked active) |

**Key differences:**

- **Claude Code & Codex** — Each running process maps to a JSONL session file with a unique session ID. This allows precise matching between live processes and DB sessions for accurate active status.
- **Cursor** — Live detection only sees the process PID, while historical sessions use composer UUIDs from `state.vscdb`. There is no way to link a running Cursor process to a specific composer session, so the most recent session is marked active when the process is running.
- **Token coverage** — Cursor does not record token counts for all sessions. Older sessions and some "default" model sessions have zero tokens. Cache token breakdown (read/write) is not available.
- **Model name** — Cursor's "default" model setting doesn't record which model was actually used on the backend. These sessions show `default` in the model column.

## Privacy

- **Fully offline** — no network requests, no data sent anywhere
- **Read-only** — never modifies agent config or data files
- All stats stored in a local SQLite database
- Delete `~/.local/share/agentic_metric/` at any time to remove all data
